// hook covers file uploads instead — but that hook is confirmed dead on
// current Claude Desktop builds (ASAR integrity enforcement blocks the
// injection), so Claude Desktop got ZERO file-content scanning of any kind
// until this was fixed. See ai-processes.js's own comments for the full story.
